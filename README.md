Blood Moon for RedM servers!

This is a modification of mm_weather of Macabre RedM, full credits to them and I recommend using the original.

WHAT'S NEW:
- Modified to meet my supernatural server
- On line 3 of server.lua you can change the start and end time of the weather (I recommend keeping it, as it is the time of intense darkness)
- In config.lua you enable or disable the function
- It is synchronized with all players by server.lua requesting the weather in the client.lua, not just a visual application for player through the client (yes, it is synchronized with all at the same time)
- On line 28 of server.lua you can change the time in which the application of the weather occurs, this is for servers that a day in the game happens in 30 minutes
- On line 19 of server.lua it checks the current server time to be able to apply or disable the weather

SOON:
- I will add schedules for the weather in config.lua, so I recommend keeping the version checker

WHY USE IT?
- Fun, maintains the tone of the otherworldly and dark server, ideal for events and Halloween
